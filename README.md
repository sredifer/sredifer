- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Samantha! I'm a second-year Computer Engineering major at UCLA.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in sustainability in technology, autonomy, machine learning/AI, and cybersecurity!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on an autonomous maze-solving robot as part of IEEE's Micromouse Project and a web application, The Colloborative Study Organizer (found in my repo :D). You can find other software projects I've worked on in my pinned repos!
