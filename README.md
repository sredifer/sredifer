- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Samantha! I'm a second-year Computer Engineering major at UCLA.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in sustainability in technology, autonomy, machine learning/AI, and cybersecurity!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on an autonomous maze-solving robot as part of IEEE's Micromouse Project and a web application, The Collaborative Study Organizer (found in my repo :D). You can find other software projects I've worked on in my pinned repos!
- ðŸ‘¥ I'm in multiple clubs/orgs at UCLA, including IEEE, IEEE-Watt, Bruin Racing Baja, and BURSA. I'm also currently the Publicity Chair for Eta Kappa Nu (HKN)!
- âš¡ A fun fact about me... I visited Thailand, Myanmar, Singapore, Vietnam, and Cambodia all in one month! :)
-  ðŸ“« You can reach me at redifer.samantha@gmail.com or sredifer@g.ucla.edu!
