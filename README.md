- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Samantha! I'm a third-year Computer Engineering major at UCLA.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in sustainability, autonomous vehicles, machine learning/AI, cybersecurity, embedded systems, and frontend web application development!
- ðŸŒ± I just completed a Software Engineering internship at Empirical Systems Aerospace in San Luis Obispo, California, where I developed and validated embedded vision and communication systems for autonomous aircraft, ensuring reliable onboardâ€“ground data flow during live flight tests!
- ðŸ‘¥ I'm in multiple clubs/orgs at UCLA, including IEEE, IEEE-Watt, and BURSA. I'm also currently the Publicity Chair for the ECE Honors Society at UCLA, Eta Kappa Nu (HKN)!
- âš¡ A fun fact about me... I visited Thailand, Myanmar, Singapore, Vietnam, and Cambodia all in one month! :)
